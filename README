This is the beginning of the Audrey code.  What's currently here are a few
things:

1)  An implementation of the Template/Assembly/Deployable XML parsing in Python.
You feed it at least one deployable, at least one assembly, and at least
one template.  It parses all of these, makes sure it can resolve all of them,
and assuming it can, it generates condor jobs corresponding to those instances,
which can then be launched.

2)  An implementation of the Template/Assembly/Deployable XML parsing in Ruby.
It's the same as the python implementation, but not as well tested and doesn't
generate the right userdata yet.  This is what we'll eventually want to
integrate into the conductor.

3)  The modifications needed to ec2 rc.local files in order to actually execute
the stuff sent out by audrey.
