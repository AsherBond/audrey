# Sample Deployables

The deployables in this directory are all standalone deployables meant to work
with any images.  They are provided purely as simple examples of what various
types of deployables could look like.

*  [deployable-sample-no-configs.xml](https://raw.github.com/aeolusproject/audrey/master/examples/deployables/deployable-sample-no-configs.xml):  The simplest example of a deployable, which contains a single assembly with no post-launch configuration.

*  [deployable-sample-single-instance.xml](https://raw.github.com/aeolusproject/audrey/master/examples/deployables/deployable-sample-single-instance.xml):  An example with a single assembly with example post-launch configuration.

*  [deployable-sample-multi-instance.xml](https://raw.github.com/aeolusproject/audrey/master/examples/deployables/deployable-sample-multi-instance.xml): A deployable that contains multiple assemblies with post-launch configuration for launching multiple instances with inter-assembly reference parameters.

*  [deployable-sample-inline.xml](https://raw.github.com/aeolusproject/audrey/master/examples/deployables/deployable-sample-inline.xml): Similar to the deployable-sample-multi-instance.xml, but contains examples of inline scripts and files.
