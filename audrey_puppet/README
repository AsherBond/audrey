Requirements:
* Puppet client package

How to use:

git clone git://git.engineering.redhat.com/users/olevy/puppet-imagebuilder/.git
cd puppet-imagebuilder

Execute ./run

This will execute puppet and apply the default configuration (as defined in nodes/default)
You may create another yaml file (which match to the output of facter fqdn) and adjust accordingly


How it works:

Puppet executes the node script, which in turn reads the yaml file based on the fqdn.
The node script, can be changed to query from any source (such as a web api, db etc).
